            <p>Started 2017</p>

            <p>This website was made to record the projects I have done and also keep track of my current extracirricular projects. A lot of the time I would start a project and forget about it, thus recording all my ongoing projects will allow me to remember to work on it. I would also use this portfolio as a 'diary' of my programming progress, allowing me to look back at decisions I made during the development process and evaluate them if there are any major issues popping up.</p>

            <p>I originally used markdown and chose a template from Github Pages. However, I decided to change to using HTML and a premade CSS template due to the lack of flexibility of markdown. <a href="https://purecss.io/" class="simple-link">Pure CSS</a> was chosen becaues its website was the one that first one to finish loading when I opened a myriad of CSS templates. Its minimalist design suited this portfolio due to this portfolio's simplicity.</p>
            
            <p>The following images show the changes in the aesthetics of the portfolio.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/minigames" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2018</p>

            <p>Minigames is a collection of terminal based minigames. These minigames are written in Python and use curses so that they can be shown in terminal. The decision to use the terminal instead of a GUI was due to its simplicity and ease of prototyping. Originally, I wanted to find optimal solutions to these minigames, however, I realised that my current knowledge was not enough, and will have to implement it at some other time.</p>

            <p>There are a collection of novel and classic minigames implemented, including flippy, tic-tac-toe etc.. However, my progress halted when I could not find free time while preparing for exams.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Calc</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/calc" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2018</p>

            <p>I created this small project as an attempt to familiarise myself with the use, traversal and manipulation of tree structures. Mathematical expressions are can be stored recursively in trees, which makes them suitable for this project. Each mathematical expression is a tree structure that (usually) has an operation as a root node. When evaluating the result of the expression, the program uses the value of the child nodes and the nature of the operation at the root node.</p>

            <p>Example: 1+(2*(3+4)+5)*6-7</p>
