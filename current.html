            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/alienonolympus.github.io" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>

            <p>This website was made to record the projects I have done and also keep track of my current extracirricular projects. A lot of the time I would start a project and forget about it, thus recording all my ongoing projects will allow me to remember to work on it. I would also use this portfolio as a 'diary' of my programming progress, allowing me to look back at decisions I made during the development process and evaluate them if there are any major issues popping up.</p>

            <p>I originally used markdown and chose a template from Github Pages. However, I decided to change to using HTML and a premade CSS template due to the lack of flexibility of markdown. <a href="https://purecss.io/" class="simple-link">Pure CSS</a> was chosen becaues its website was the one that first one to finish loading when I opened a myriad of CSS templates. Its minimalist design suited this portfolio due to this portfolio's simplicity.</p>
            
            <p>The following images show the changes in the aesthetics of the portfolio.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Webcite</h2>

            <p><a href="#" class="simple-link">Link to repository (not setup yet)</a></p>

            <p>RefMe, a citation website, was shutdown and merged into <a href="http://www.citethisforme.com/" class="simple-link">Cite This For Me</a> The merged website was not as responsive and did not support saving your bibliographies. Of course, these features were included in the premium version but I was reluctant to pay for a citation service. As a result, I decided to create my own version that would scrape information from websites and create a bibliography that can be saved online.</p>

            <p>The core web scraping was done by requesting the source file of the URL and looking for metadata such as the author and date modified of a website. It is fairly straightforward except for the inclusion of a logistic regression learning algorithm used to 'find' the author when the author is not explicitly stated. The inclusion of this logistic regression learner was just for fun. The learner was trained with 7 features of text in links found on the website: inclusion of numbers; amount of 'words' with only alphabets; whether there is a first name matching the contents of a csv file; whether there is a surname matching the contents of a csv file; whether there is a word matching the contents of a csv file of common words used; length of the text; how many words are capitalised. The trained parameters were fairly accurate, although it can get confused when there are other names that are not related to the author of a website.</p>

            <p>Here is the web scraping in action on an early version of webcite:</p>
