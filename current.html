            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/alienonolympus.github.io" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2017</p>

            <p>This website was made to record the projects I have done and also keep track of my current extracirricular projects. A lot of the time I would start a project and forget about it, thus recording all my ongoing projects will allow me to remember to work on it. I would also use this portfolio as a 'diary' of my programming progress, allowing me to look back at decisions I made during the development process and evaluate them if there are any major issues popping up.</p>

            <p>I originally used markdown and chose a template from Github Pages. However, I decided to change to using HTML and a premade CSS template due to the lack of flexibility of markdown. <a href="https://purecss.io/" class="simple-link">Pure CSS</a> was chosen becaues its website was the one that first one to finish loading when I opened a myriad of CSS templates. Its minimalist design suited this portfolio due to this portfolio's simplicity.</p>
            
            <p>The following images show the changes in the aesthetics of the portfolio.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Webcite</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/webcite" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2017</p>

            <p>RefMe, a citation website, was shutdown and merged into <a href="http://www.citethisforme.com/" class="simple-link">Cite This For Me</a> The merged website was not as responsive and did not support saving your bibliographies. Of course, these features were included in the premium version but I was reluctant to pay for a citation service. As a result, I decided to create my own version that would scrape information from websites and create a bibliography that can be saved online.</p>

            <p>The core web scraping was done by requesting the source file of the URL and looking for metadata such as the author and date modified of a website. It is fairly straightforward except for the inclusion of a logistic regression learning algorithm used to 'find' the author when the author is not explicitly stated. The inclusion of this logistic regression learner was just for fun. The learner was trained with 7 features of text in links found on the website: inclusion of numbers; amount of 'words' with only alphabets; whether there is a first name matching the contents of a csv file; whether there is a surname matching the contents of a csv file; whether there is a word matching the contents of a csv file of common words used; length of the text; how many words are capitalised. The trained parameters were fairly accurate, although it can get confused when there are other names that are not related to the author of a website.</p>

            <p>Here is the web scraping in action on an early version of webcite:</p>

            <div class="pure-g">
                <video class="pure-vid-responsive" controls>
                    <source src="vid/webcite1.ogv" type="video/ogg">
                </video>
            </div>
            
            <p>After finishing the core web scraping program, I moved on to creating a wrapper using HTML and making a webapp. I tried implementing this in many different Python frameworks such as Django and Flask but my progress was slow as this was my first time creating a webapp. Being impatient, I decided to take the easiest route and use PHP. This made it slightly more complicated to use the core web scraper which was written in Python and modifications had to made. A Python file acts as the interface between the webapp and the website written in PHP. Different parameters can be passed onto this file for it to do different things, allowing the PHP to run the Python file using exec and passing necessary arguments. Another choice I made was to not use any existing PHP framework such as Laravel as I would learn a lot more. This also let me know how everything works instead of blindly following a tutorial listing out functions from a library. However, this made my code extremely messy and would make implementing CSS significantly harder.</p>

            <p>When trying to implement CSS, I realised that using an existing framework such as Boostrap would be almost impossible as I had to rewrite a significant portion of my code. Consequently, I decided to simply write my own stylesheets. Still, I had to rewrite part of my code which included adding divs and tables in order to structure the content of the webpage. I did not make use of flexbox as I was still unfamiliar with flexbox and wished to create something visually appealing fast.</p>

            <p>Here is some screenshots of webcite after I added CSS to it: </p>

                <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Minigames</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/minigames" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2018</p>

            <p>Minigames is a collection of terminal based minigames. These minigames are written in Python and use curses so that they can be shown in terminal. The decision to use the terminal instead of a GUI was due to its simplicity and ease of prototyping. I also want to try to find optimal solutions to each minigame if possible.</p>

            <p>The first minigame is flippy, which is a simple game where you have to try to flip all the white spots by walking over them. However, you can only move 500 times. The white spots are generated randomly and your starting position is generated randomly.</p>
