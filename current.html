            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/alienonolympus.github.io" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2017</p>

            <p>This website was made to record the projects I have done and also keep track of my current extracirricular projects. A lot of the time I would start a project and forget about it, thus recording all my ongoing projects will allow me to remember to work on it. I would also use this portfolio as a 'diary' of my programming progress, allowing me to look back at decisions I made during the development process and evaluate them if there are any major issues popping up.</p>

            <p>I originally used markdown and chose a template from Github Pages. However, I decided to change to using HTML and a premade CSS template due to the lack of flexibility of markdown. <a href="https://purecss.io/" class="simple-link">Pure CSS</a> was chosen becaues its website was the one that first one to finish loading when I opened a myriad of CSS templates. Its minimalist design suited this portfolio due to this portfolio's simplicity.</p>
            
            <p>The following images show the changes in the aesthetics of the portfolio.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Miniprograms</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/minigames" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2018</p>

            <p>Originally started as minigames, miniprograms was a collection of terminal based minigames. These programs are written in Python and use curses so that they can be shown in terminal. The decision to use the terminal instead of a GUI was due to its simplicity and ease of prototyping. I wanted to find optimal solutions to these games but I realised that my current knowledge was not enough, and will have to implement it at a later date.</p>

            <p>There are a collection of novel and classic games and programs implemented, including flippy, tic-tac-toe, Conway's Game of Life etc.. However, my progress halted when I could not find free time while preparing for exams.</p>

            <p>I now intend to use miniprograms as a way to store my smaller projects (including the previous games) that are not large enough to form their own repository.</p>


            <h2 class="content-subhead">IB Notes</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/alienonolympus/ibnotes" class="simple-link">Link to repository</a></p>
            
            <p>Started 2018</p>

            <p>I decided to take notes for my subjects at the end of each unit while doing my IB diploma. I chose LaTeX as the format to write these notes in because it made it easier to store it (OneDrive is not intuitive enough for me) and control each version. It also allows me </p>
